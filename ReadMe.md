## React Skeleton

An opinionated React Skeleton.

The default install incluedes a project that shows usages for a few of the concepts with a higher amount of idiosyncracies.

Among those are:
`Providers` and `Consumers`
Setting up a `useRedux` hook at the root level
`custom hooks`
`useRef` to persist data through state changes
`useRef` (multiple variations) to acess the DOM from functional components

Included is also a script to remove the default project and leave only the basic structure behind.
`$ cd <PROJECT_ROOT> && ./structure`
> NOTE: You cannot undo this action - If you want to leave the default project it is highly recommended to run the following:

`$ cd <PROJECT_ROOT> && rm structure`
